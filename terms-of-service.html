              or Sutton Bank (each, an <strong>“Issuer”</strong>) of a VISA-branded reloadable virtual debit card (the
              <strong>“Virtual Card”</strong>) for the Authorized Users to make digital purchases for the Corporate
              Member; and (ii) if subscribed, provision of software consumption monitoring system as further described
              below (the <strong>“Subscribed Service”</strong>).
            </p>

            <p>
              The Virtual Card allows the Authorized Users to pay for digital purchase of SaaS applications such as
              Zoom, Slack, Dropbox, Facebook Ad, and other pre-approved vendors as determined by the Corporate Member
              (each, an <strong>“Approved Vendor”</strong>).
            </p>

            <p>The subscribed Subscribed Services offers the following features:</p>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                Identify Spending Pattern: Gather spend data by the Authorized Users and track how much the Corporate
                Member spends on Approved Vendors on an ongoing basis.
              </li>
              <li>
                Monitor Consumption: Monitor how many units of an Approved Vendor’s SaaS applications feature are being
                used by employees.

                Provide Insights and Recommendations: Based on the spending patterns and utilization of Approved
                Vendors’ SaaS applications, provide recommendations to optimize the Corporate Member’s spending on the
                Account dashboard, such recommendations may include identifying duplicate applications performing
                substantially similar functions, unused applications, and potential discounts for different subscription
                terms.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>

            <h3>Governing Law</h3>

            </p>
            <p>
              You agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of the Site, including all disputes, will be
              governed by the laws of the United States and by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
              conflicts of law’s provisions. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and
              federal courts in Alameda County, California, and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue. The
              preceding provision regarding venue does not apply if you are a consumer based in the European Union. If
              you are a consumer based in the European Union, you may make a claim in the courts of the country where
              you reside. Any claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of
              action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred. Claims made under the separate terms and
              conditions of purchase for goods and services are not subject to this limitation. No recovery may be
              sought or received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses, except that the prevailing party will be
              entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. In the event of any controversy or dispute between Apple and you
              arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good
              faith, to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within a reasonable time
              (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party may submit such controversy or dispute to mediation.
              If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any right or
              remedy available to them under applicable law.

            <h3>Formal Claims</h3>
            <p>
              We encourage you to contact us directly if you have any concerns with respect to the operation of the
              Website or our Service or our Subscription Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, if you conclude that we have not satisfied your concern and that you must pursue legal action,
              you agree that your claim must be resolved by the processes set forth in these Terms. You agree that prior
              to initiating any formal proceedings against Quolum, you will send a notice to our attorneys at the
              provided address and state that you are providing a “Notice of Dispute.” Upon receipt of a Notice of
              Dispute, you and we shall attempt to resolve the dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60)
              days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent. If the dispute remains unresolved, either you or we may
              initiate formal proceedings according to these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Except where our dispute is being resolved pursuant to an arbitration (as provided below), you agree that
              any claim or dispute you may have against Quolum must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court
              located in Alameda, California. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts
              located within Alameda, California (and, for the avoidance of doubt, to exclude the jurisdiction of any
              other court) for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>
              If the Parties are unable to resolve a dispute through informal negotiations, the dispute (except those
              disputes expressly excluded herein) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. You
              understand that without this provision, you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
              The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
              Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
              Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your
              arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules
              and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined to by the
              arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be
              conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a
              decision in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either party. The
              arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
              Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take
              place in Alameda, California. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to
              compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment
              on the award entered by the arbitrator.
            </p>
            <p>
              If for any reason, a dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the dispute shall be commenced or
              prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Alameda, California, and the parties hereby consent
              to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum with respect to venue and
              jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
              for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are
              excluded from these Terms.
