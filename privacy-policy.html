        <h3 id="WIDWC">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>In Short: </strong>
          We collect information directly from you when you register on our Website, provide us your contact
          information, subscribe to our Services. We also automatically collect from you your usage information, cookies
          and similar technologies.
        </p>

        <h4>Personal Information</h4>
        <p>
          While using our Service, we may ask you (or for Corporate Member Accounts, your employers) to provide us with
          certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally
          identifiable information may include, but is not limited to any information about you which could, alone or
          together with other information, personally identify you or otherwise be reasonably linked or connected with
          you. Information such as a username and password, an email address, a real name, date of birth, an Internet
          protocol (IP) address, contact information, billing information are examples of “Personal Information.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information that does not
          identify you or cannot otherwise be reasonably linked or connected with you. We may use such aggregated,
          non-personally identifying information for research purposes and to operate, analyze, improve, and optimize
          our Website and Services.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you provide us with personal information of another individual/entity that requires consent, it is your
          duty to make sure that the individual/entity has consented to or is appropriately informed about the
          processing of their personal information by Quolum.
        </p>

        <h4>Usage Data</h4>
        <p>
          We may automatically collect some basic information when you visit or otherwise use our Services, subject,
          where necessary, to your consent. This includes information about how you use the Service, such your
          computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our
          Services that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device
          identifiers and other diagnostic data. This information may include your Personal information, Cookies and
          Tracking and Analytics information.
        </p>

        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>
          To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve our Services, we use
          cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixel tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and
          your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services.
          Cookies are small text files that websites place on the computers and mobile devices of people who visit those
          websites. These files are then read by the website each time you return to the site. Most web browsers are set
          to accept cookies by default. However, you may also set your browser to block cookies and similar
          technologies, but this action may block our essential cookies and prevent our website from functioning
          properly, and you may not be able to fully utilize all of its features and services. You should visit your
          browser's help menu for more information on this.
        </p>

        <h4>Tacking and Analytics Information</h4>
        <p>
          We use a number of third-party analytics such as Google analytics data and service providers to help us
          evaluate your use of our Services, compile statistical reports on activity, and improve our content and
          Website performance. Some of the tracking technologies used by us are beacons, tags, and scripts to collect
          and track information and to improve and analyze our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
          feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
          browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
          implementing DNT signals has been finalized by us. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals
          or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
          revised version of this privacy notice.
        </p>

        <h4>Employer Provided Information</h4>
        <p>
          Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer, provide us with personal data about you and
          your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their employees. For example, we will get
          Personally Identifiable information for authorizing users of our Services.

          able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. While we will
          do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of such personal information to and from our

            </p>

              <li>
                <strong>the right to request for information pursuant: </strong>you have the right to know the
                categories of personal information we have collected about you; the categories of sources from which the

                unless an exception applies, such as when the information is necessary to complete the transaction or
                contract for which it was collected or when it is being used to detect, prevent, or investigate security

              <li>
                <strong>the right to equal services and prices:</strong> the CCPA prohibits businesses from
                discriminating against you for exercising your rights under the law. Such discrimination may include
                denying services, charging different prices or rates for services, providing a different level or

                services as a result of exercising your rights.
