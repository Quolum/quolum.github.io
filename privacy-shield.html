        <h5>
          IMPORTANT: These Terms include resolution of Disputes by arbitration instead of in court and class action
          waiver. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.
        </h5>

        <p>
          This Privacy Shield Statement <strong>("Policy")</strong> describes how Quolum, Inc. and its subsidiaries and
          affiliates in the United States <strong>("US") ("Company," "we," or "us")</strong> collect, use, and disclose
          certain personally identifiable information that we receive in the US from the European Economic Area
          (<strong>"EEA"</strong>) and the United Kingdom (<strong>"UK"</strong>) (<strong>"Personal Data"</strong>).
          This Statement supplements our Privacy Policy located at:
          <a href="https://quolum.com/privacy-policy">[LINK]</a> (the <strong>"Privacy Policy"</strong>), and unless
          specifically defined in this Policy, the terms in this Statement have the same meaning as the Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Company recognizes that the EEA and the UK have established strict protections regarding the handling of
          Personal Data, including requirements to provide adequate protection for Personal Data transferred outside of
          the EEA and the UK. To provide adequate protection for certain Personal Data about corporate customers and
          their end-users received in the US from the EEA and the UK, the Company has elected to self-certify to the
          EU-US Privacy Shield Framework administered by the US Department of Commerce (<strong>"Privacy Shield"</strong
          >). The Company adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward
          Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability.
        </p>

        <p>
          For purposes of enforcing compliance with the Privacy Shield, the Company is subject to the investigatory and
          enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission. For more information about the Privacy Shield, see
          the US Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield website located at: https://www.privacyshield.gov. To review
          the Company’s representation on the Privacy Shield list, see the US Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield
          self-certification list located at:
          <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Personal Data Collection and Use</u></h3>
        <p>
          Our Privacy Policy located describes the categories of Personal Data that we may receive in the US as well as
          the purposes for which we use that Personal Data. The Company will only process Personal Data in ways that are
          compatible with the purpose that the Company collected it for, or for purposes the individual later
          authorizes. Before we use your Personal Data for a purpose that is materially different than the purpose we
          collected it for or that you later authorized, we will provide you with the opportunity to opt out. The
          Company maintains reasonable procedures to help ensure that Personal Data is reliable for its intended use,
          accurate, complete, and current.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Data Transfers to Third Parties</u></h3>

        <p>
          <strong><u>Third-Party Agents or Service Providers.</u></strong>
          We may transfer Personal Data to our third-party agents or service providers who perform functions on our
          behalf as described in our Privacy Policy. Where required by the Privacy Shield, we enter into written
          agreements with those third-party agents and service providers requiring them to provide the same level of
          protection the Privacy Shield requires and limiting their use of the data to the specified services provided
          on our behalf. We take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that third-party agents and service
          providers process Personal Data in accordance with our Privacy Shield obligations and to stop and remediate
          any unauthorized processing. Under certain circumstances, we may remain liable for the acts of our third-party
          agents or service providers who perform services on our behalf for their handling of Personal Data that we
          transfer to them.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong><u>Disclosures for National Security or Law Enforcement.</u></strong>
          Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your Personal Data in response to valid requests
          by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Security</u></h3>
        <p>
          The Company maintains reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse,
          unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction in accordance with the Privacy Shield.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Access Rights</u></h3>
        <p>
          You may have the right to access the Personal Data that we hold about you and to request that we correct,
          amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the Privacy Shield. These access rights
          may not apply in some cases, including where providing access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under
          the circumstances or where it would violate the rights of someone other than the individual requesting access.
          If you would like to request access to, correction, amendment, or deletion of your Personal Data, you can
          submit a written request to the contact information provided below. We may request specific information from
          you to confirm your identity. In some circumstances we may charge a reasonable fee for access to your
          information.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Questions or Complaints</u></h3>
        <p>
          You can direct any questions or complaints about the use or disclosure of your Personal Data to us at
          <a>privacy@quolum.com</a> or by mail at the address below:

          We will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints or disputes regarding the use or disclosure of your

        </p>

        <h3><u>Binding Arbitration.</u></h3>
        <p>
          If you are a resident of the European Union and are dissatisfied with the manner in which we have addressed
          your concerns about our privacy practices, you may seek further assistance, at no cost to you, from our
          designated Privacy Shield independent recourse mechanism:
        </p>

        <a href="https://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html">
          American Arbitration Association/International Center for Dispute Resolution
        </a>
        <p>
          Residents of the European Union may elect to arbitrate unresolved complaints but prior to initiating such
          arbitration, you must: (1) contact and afford us the opportunity to resolve the issue; (2) seek assistance
          from our designated independent recourse mechanism above; and (3) contact the U.S. Department of Commerce
          (either directly or through a European Data Protection) and afford the Department of Commerce time to attempt
          to resolve the issue. Each party shall be responsible for its own attorney’s fees. Please be advised that,
          pursuant to the Privacy Shield, the arbitrator(s) may only impose individual-specific, non-monetary, equitable
          relief necessary to remedy any violation of the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the individual.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Changes To This Statement</u></h3>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to amend this Statement from time to time consistent with the Privacy Shield's
          requirements.
