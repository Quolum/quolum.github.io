                <p>
                  The Business Account is an account made available to the Business Account Owner to facilitate the
                  issuance of Cards that may be used by Authorized Users for commercial business purposes. Each Card
                  Account is a national sub-account of the Business Account that will enable the Business Account Owner
                  to track the balance of funds allocated to the Card linked to such Card Account. The Card allows
                  Authorized Users to access funds allocated to the Card by the Business Administrator, subject to the
                  limitations established by the Business Administrator. Neither the Business Account nor a Card Account
                  constitutes a checking or savings account. The Card is not a gift card, nor is it intended to be used
                  for gifting purposes. The Card is not a credit card. Business Account Owner will not receive any
                  interest on the funds in the Business Account or any Card Account. The Card will remain the property
                  of the Bank and must be surrendered upon demand. The Card cannot be redeemed for cash. The Card is
                  nontransferable and may be canceled or revoked at any time without prior notice except as required by
                  law. The Business Administrator will determine whether a Card issued to an Authorized User will be a
                  physical Card or virtual Card. The Bank may, in its sole discretion, limit the number of Cards that
                  may be issued on behalf of the Business Account Owner. The Business Administrator shall have full
                  power and agrees to administer the Business Account and each Card Account only as described in this
                  Agreement and as duly authorized by the Business Account Owner. The Business Administrator will be
                  authorized to limit or restrict the activity on all Cards with or without the consent of any
                  Authorized User. The Business Administrator will also be authorized to make changes to the Card
                  Account with or without the consent of any Authorized User. The Business Account Owner is the owner of
                  all funds in the Business Account and allocated to any Card Account at all times and each Authorized
                  User agrees that the Card shall only be used as authorized by the Business Account Owner. Business
                  Account Owner acknowledges and agrees that the value available in the Business Account and any Card
                  Account is limited to the funds that have been added to the Business Account or allocated to any Card
                  Account pursuant to these Terms.

                <p>
                  Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, Business Administrator may only add funds to
                  the Business Account as described in this Section 6.4. Business Administrator may not add funds to the
                  Business Account by sending personal checks, cashier’s checks, or money orders to the Bank. The Bank
                  will return all checks and money orders unless the Business Account has a negative balance, in which
                  case the Bank may, in its sole discretion, apply the proceeds of the check or money order towards the
                  negative balance of the Business Account. Business Administrator may provide such authorization and
                  Business Account Owner’s Bank Account information via the Website. Amounts debited from the Bank
                  Account will be added to the Business Account and available for allocation to the Card Accounts
                  generally within three (3) business days of when we receive the authorization and all required
                  consents and information.

                <p>
                  Only funds in the Business Account may be allocated to a Card Account and accessed utilizing a Card. A
                  Business Administrator may set certain limits (“Settings”) for each Card and the allocated Card
                  Account through the Website. Authorized Users will not be permitted to establish or modify the
                  Settings. For example, a Business Administrator may establish Settings that limit the amount of funds
                  that may be allocated to a Card Account or the amount of transactions that may be performed with a
                  Card in a day or month. A Business Administrator may change the Settings from time to time via the
                  Website without an Authorized User’s consent. New Settings and changes to existing Settings will be
                  effective only after we have a reasonable period of time to process the new settings or changes.

                  In addition to and without limiting our rights under this Agreement, a Business Administrator may
                  suspend or cancel a Card Account at any time by changing the Settings on the Website (See Section 6.5
                  above). Upon the suspension or cancellation of a Card Account, the Authorized User may no longer be
                  able to use the Card Account or the associated Card.

                  Transactions approved and processed with the Card may only be used to purchase goods and services for
                  business purposes only and not for personal, family or household purposes.

                <p>
                  When a Business Administrator notifies us to revoke an Authorized User, we will close the applicable
                  Card Account and Authorized User may no longer use the Card once we have processed such revocation.

                <p>
                  Business Account Owner must notify us via e-mail at
                  <a mail:to="help@quolum.com">help@quolum.com</a> to revoke permission for any Business Administrator
                  to administer the Business Account and Card Account(s). Any revocation of such permission will be
                  effective only after we have a reasonable period of time to process Business Account Owner’s
                  withdrawal.

                <p>
                  A Business Administrator or Authorized User must activate a Card before it can be used. A Business
                  Administrator or Authorized User may activate a Card on the Website. In order to activate a physical
                  Card you will need to provide certain User Information so we can verify your identity. Business
                  Administrator may activate a virtual Card on the Website.

                <p>
                  Authorized Users should treat the Card with the same care as cash. Always protect the Card and keep it
                  in a safe place. Do not send a Card number in an email or text message. Make sure Card and Access
                  Information is secured with encryption when used to perform transactions over the Internet or wireless
                  networks.

                <h4><u>6.14 Lost or Stolen Card, or Unauthorized Access to Business Account.</u></h4>
                <p>
                  The Card is a commercial card and does not provide consumer protections for lost or stolen Cards or
                  unauthorized transactions. Treat the Card like cash.
                  <strong>
                    Until a Business Administrator or Authorized User reports a Card as lost or stolen or reports an
                    unauthorized transaction on a Business Account or Card Account, Business Account Owner is fully
                    responsible for all transactions, even if the Card is lost, stolen or used for unauthorized
                    transactions.
                  </strong>
                  Contact Customer Service IMMEDIATELY if a Business Administrator or Authorized User believes: (a) a
                  Card has been lost or stolen, (b) someone has gained unauthorized access to any Access Information, or
                  (c) someone has transferred or may transfer funds from the Business Account or a Card Account without
                  a Business Administrator’s or Authorized User’s permission. Reporting a lost/stolen Card or
                  unauthorized transactions by calling +1 925-364-5456 or by logging into the Website
                  <a href="https://quolum.com/">https://quolum.com/</a> to deactivate the card is the best way to
                  minimize possible losses. Unless we have authorized a transaction after a Business Account or Card
                  Account is blocked, Business Account Owner and Authorized User are responsible for all unauthorized
                  transactions initiated and fees incurred from the unauthorized use of a Card. Failure to promptly
                  notify us could result in the Business Account Owner losing ALL of the money in the Business Account
                  and the associated Card Accounts.

                <h4><u>6.15 Using A Card.</u></h4>
                <p>
                  Cards may not be used for ATM cash withdrawals, may not be used for Business payroll payments, and may
                  only be used for purchases within United States and Internationally, subject to restricted countries.
                  Authorized User may use a Card to make purchases at any merchant that accepts Visa network brand debit
                  cards or debit cards of other networks in which the Bank participates, subject to the available Card
                  Account balance, the transaction limits and transaction restrictions outlined below, and the other
                  terms and condition of this Agreement. If Authorized User uses a Card number without presenting the
                  Card (such as for a mail order, telephone, or Internet purchase), the legal effect will be the same as
                  if Authorized User used the Card itself. Each time Authorized User uses a Card, Business Account Owner
                  and Authorized User authorizes us to reduce the value available in the Card Account by the amount of
                  the transaction and any applicable fees. Authorized User is not allowed to exceed the amount of the
                  available funds in the Business Account or allocated to his or her Card Account, whichever is less,
                  through an individual transaction or a series of transactions. Nevertheless, if a transaction exceeds
                  the amount of available funds in the Business Account or allocated to an Authorized User’s Card
                  Account, Business Account Owner will be fully liable to us for the full amount of the transaction and
                  any applicable fees. We may refuse to process a transaction, or temporarily “freeze” a Card Account
                  and attempt to contact a Business Administrator if we notice transactions that are unusual or appear
                  suspicious, or use of the Card that are not consistent with its intended use.

                  When Authorized User uses a Card or Card number to initiate a transaction at certain merchant
                  locations, such as hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and rental car companies, where the final
                  purchase amount is unknown at the time of authorization, a hold may be placed on the available funds
                  in the Card Account for an amount equal to or in excess of the final transaction amount. The funds
                  subject to the hold will not be available to Business Account Owner or Authorized User for any other
                  purpose until the merchant sends us the final transaction amount. Once we receive the final
                  transaction amount, it may take up to seven days for the hold to be removed. During that period,
                  Business Account Owner and Authorized User will not have access to the funds subject to the hold.
                  Please be advised that Authorized User may experience difficulties using a Card at unattended vending
                  machines, kiosks, and gas station pumps. If a Card is declined at a “pay at the pump” gas station even
                  though Authorized User has sufficient funds available, Authorized User should pay for the purchase
                  inside with the cashier.

                  amount that can be spent using a Card Account is $200,000 per transaction, $200,000 per day and
                  $200,000 per month. In order to protect the Card Account, we may temporarily impose limits on the
                  dollar amount, number, and type of transactions performed using a Card and the Card Account. To the
                  extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to: (a) change the transaction limits; (b)
                  limit, block, or place a hold on certain types of transfers or transactions: and (c) limit, suspend,

                <p>
                  Business Account Owner is responsible for all transactions initiated and fees incurred by use of a
                  Card and Card Account. If a Business Administrator or an Authorized User permit another person to have
                  access to a Card or Card number, we will treat this as if the Business Administrator has authorized
                  such person to use the Card, and Business Account Owner will be liable for all transactions and fees
                  incurred by such person, even if they exceed the authorization granted. Business Account Owner will
                  further be responsible for any transactions made and any fees incurred by the Authorized User even if
                  the Authorized User exceeds the scope of the authority granted to such Authorized User by Business
                  Account Owner. Transactions will be considered unauthorized only after a Business Administrator
                  notifies us that the person is no longer authorized to use the Card.

                <h4><u>6.21 Card Account Balance.</u></h4>
                <p>
                  It is important to know the amount of available funds in the Card Account before performing a
                  transaction with a Card. If there are not sufficient funds in the Card Account to cover the
                  transaction amount, the transaction will be declined. If Authorized User does not have sufficient
                  funds in the Card Account, Authorized User can request that the merchant charge a part of the purchase
                  to the Card and pay the remaining amount with cash or another card. These are called “split
                  transactions.” Some merchants do not allow cardholders to conduct split transactions. Business Account
                  Owner and Authorized User acknowledges and agrees that the funds available to perform transactions are
                  limited to the available funds that have been added to the Card Account that are not subject to a
                  hold. Authorized User is not authorized to use any funds added to the Card Account in error. Any
                  transaction that could create a negative balance for the Business Account or a Card Account is not
                  permitted, but may occur in limited circumstances. Adjustments may be made to the Card Account to
                  reverse an error, reflect a merchant adjustment, or resolve a dispute regarding a transaction posted
                  to the Card Account. These processing and adjustment entries could cause the Business Account or Card
                  Account to have a negative balance. If a Business Account or Card Account has a negative balance,
                  Business Account Owner and Authorized User agrees: (a) that the balance of Business Account can be
                  adjusted to reflect that amount; (b) that we may automatically apply any subsequent deposits to the
                  Business Account to satisfy the negative balance and (c) to pay us on demand by a personal check,
                  money order, or other payment method authorized by us for the amount of the negative balance. If no
                  future funds are added to the Card Account, we may send Business Account Owner a notice explaining the
                  reason for the adjustment and requesting payment by a personal check, money order, or other payment
                  method to satisfy the negative balance. Payments should be mailed to us at the address stated in the
                  applicable notice.

                  In order for the Business Administrator to use Program services with a mobile device, the Business

                  verify such number or text message address as instructed by us. To verify that mobile device number or
                  text message address, we may send a code via text message to the mobile device number or text message
                  address provided, and require the code to be entered as instructed by us. If the Business
                  Administrator’s mobile device number or text message address changes, the Business Administrator must
                  promptly provide and verify the new mobile device number or text message address.

                  Authorized User will not receive cash refunds for Card transactions. If a merchant gives Authorized
                  User a credit for merchandise returns or adjustments, the merchant may do so by processing a credit
                  adjustment, which we will credit to the available funds in the Card Account. We are not responsible
                  for the delivery, quality, safety, legality, or any other aspects of goods or services that Authorized
                  User purchases with a Card. All such disputes must be addressed and handled directly with the merchant
                  from whom those goods or services were purchased.

                  expires even if there are no funds in the Card Account. If Authorized User needs to replace a Card for
                  any reason, please contact a Business Administrator, who should contact Customer Service. The Business
                  Administrator will need to provide certain User Information so we can verify their identity.

                  the transfer despite reasonable precautions taken by us; (c) the system, or point-of-sale terminal was
                  not working properly and a Business Administrator or Authorized User knew about the problem when
                  Authorized User initiated the transaction; (d) the funds in the Card Account are subject to legal

                  arising under this Agreement prior to such cancellation or suspension. In the event that a Card
                  Account is cancelled, closed, or terminated for any reason, a Business Administrator may request the
                  unused balance to be returned to the Business Account or to Business Account Owner via a check to the
                  mailing address we have in our records.

                  Owner nd us (including the interpretation and scope of this Section 5.42 and the arbitrability of the
                  controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action) relating to the Cards, the Business Account,
                  Card Accounts, or these Terms (as well as any related or prior agreement that Business Account Owner
                  may have had with us), Business Account Owner and we agree to resolve any such controversy, dispute,
                  demand, claim, or cause of action exclusively through binding and confidential arbitration and the
                  terms of this Section. The arbitration will take place in the federal judicial district located in the
                  borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, or in the alternative, may be conducted telephonically at
                  your request. As used in this Section, “we” and “us” mean Bank and its subsidiaries, affiliates,

                <p>
                  Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The
                  arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator from the American Arbitration
                  Association (“AAA”) with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes. As modified
                  by these Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be
                  governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the
                  Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “Rules and Procedures”).
                  Notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief in
                  federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal
                  judicial district of Business Account Owner’s principal place of business residence in order to
                  maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and each party hereby agrees to submit to the exclusive
                  personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the federal judicial district of Business Account
                  Owner’s principal place of business for such purpose. A request for interim measures will not be
                  deemed a waiver of the obligation to arbitrate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Business Account Owner agrees to the following in connection with any arbitration: (a) no class or
                  similar group arbitration will be permitted; (b) the arbitration will be confidential, and neither
                  Business Account Owner nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration,
                  except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (c) subject
                  to Section 6.41 (Limitation of Liability), the arbitrator may award any individual relief or
                  individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law; and (d) each party will pay its
                  own attorneys’ fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing
                  party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys’ fees and
                  expenses to the prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined
                  by the applicable law.
                </p>
                <p>Business Account Owner understands and agrees that, by agreeing to these Terms:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY;</li>
                  <li>YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A COURT RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US; and</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  This Section will survive termination of the Card Account or these Terms as well as any voluntary
                  payment of any debt in full by Business Account Owner or bankruptcy by Business Account Owner, or any
                  bankruptcy by us. With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) of this Section (prohibiting arbitration
                  on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid,
                  unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of
                  this arbitration provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as
                  if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting part was not contained herein.
